General
1.
Where can I find a copy of the Water Ł Plan?
Please see www.capetown.gov/thinkwater.
2.
How can Day Zero be avoided?
The only way we can avoid Day Zero is if all Capetonians join in the savings drive and immediately
reduce their consumption to below 50 litres per person per day. This will bring our collective
consumption to 450 million litres a day. If daily consumption continues to exceed this target, Day Zero
will be a reality.
Consumption is monitored daily, and restrictions and the city-wide usage target could change at short
notice. The City will lower the target to required levels, whichever these may be for the scenario faced
at the time.
The Day Zero date will be pushed back into later in the year through more aggressive demand
management and hence our call to action to Team Cape Town to help reduce water usage even
further. The agricultural sector, which is also a major user in the Western Cape Supply System, will be
reaching its water allocation limit based on the production season, which would reduce the pressure
on the system and assist with moving Day Zero out to later in the year.
This City administration will continue to move mountains to get us through this unprecedented
drought.
Our augmentation programmes will assist us in the medium term and into the long term to become a
more resilient city.
3.
When will we no longer have access to municipal water at our properties?
As of 18 January 2018, Day Zero is listed on the www.capetown.gov.za/dayzerodashboard as 12
April 2018. Day Zero depends on a host of changing factors, for example whether we reduce our daily
water usage. The more we save, the further Day Zero will move and we will have a better chance to
reach our winter season’s rains, without having to turn off the taps. The operations of Day Zero will
follow a phased approach.
4.
What would trigger Day Zero?
Day Zero will take effect when dam levels are at 13, 5%.
Any changes to this figure will be communicated in due course.
Page 3 of 25Day Zero is the day that the municipality takes control of the municipal water supply in a phased
approach in order to stretch this supply, until the dams are at a sufficient level to allow water to be
distributed via the reticulation system once again.
5.
Who will stay connected?
We will prioritise some key areas to stay connected on Day Zero (the day when the taps are turned
off). Densely populated informal settlements will stay connected, as many of them are already using
standpipes to collect water. Critical infrastructure, population density and risk profile for disease
outbreak are some of the factors that the City will take into account to decide which areas stay
connected.
Strategic commercial areas, high-density areas with significant risk of increased burden of disease,
and critical services, such as hospitals and clinics, where possible, will continue to receive drinking
water through the reticulation network.
Significant monitoring and enforcement will be put in place to ensure that water usage at these points
is significantly reduced.
Our priority will be to keep strategic economic areas and industrial areas connected, in order for the
economy to continue to function, to minimise the impact of this disaster on job losses, and ensure that
people continue to get paid.
Despite this, the impact of Day Zero on the economy of Cape Town will be catastrophic - and avoiding
Day Zero is crucial if we are to stave off massive job losses.
We are engaging with as many of these organisations as possible to work out what will be the best
way to meet their water needs in a Day Zero scenario. The crisis that we face requires a whole of
society approach. We will be discussing what strategies organisations such as this will employ to
meet their water needs in the case of Day Zero – and how we can support these strategies in our
planning and implementation of the Water Disaster Plan.
6.
What key institutions and facilities will remain connected and receive water supply via
the water reticulation system?
Strategic commercial areas, high-density areas with significant risk of increased burden of disease,
such as informal settlements, and critical services, such as hospitals, old age homes, prisons,
hospitals, fire stations, police stations, clinics, children homes, where possible, will continue to receive
drinking water through normal channels. Significant monitoring and enforcement will be put in place to
ensure that water usage at these points is significantly reduced.
Page 4 of 257.
What will happen on Day Zero?
Day Zero is the day when dam levels reach 13,5% and the taps will be turned off in a phased
approach.
We will use the reticulation network to supply approximately 200 water collection sites with water. The
public will be informed of the nearest collection site in advance before we reach Day Zero.
The City is looking at a number of ways to distribute water to residents once this happens. These
include engaging with major food retailers to act as water distribution points. We will also deploy water
tankers to deliver water to key institutions, which will be cut off from the supply of water through the
reticulation network.

The City will provide water to residents through the water collection points. Water tankers will be
used to deliver water to vulnerable groups such as old age homes and care facilities. We are
also engaging retailers and the bottled water association to ramp up their distribution networks
to increase bottled water supply, so that those who do not want to use the water collection
points can purchase water. The quantity of 25 litres per person per day is in line with the World
Health Organisation’s recommendation.
 Each Water Collection Site will supply water for approximately 20 000 people.
 The City’s Water and Sanitation Department will monitor Day Zero’s impact on sanitation
services. We will launch an extensive public health communication campaign before Day Zero
to ensure that all sanitation systems continue to function and limit the risk and spread of
disease.

The City is working with the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the National Defence
Force (SANDF) to ensure the safety of residents and the collection sites. SAPS and SANDF will
be present to maintain law and order. The City conducted a pilot of a water collection site in
Maitland on 9 November 2017. We have trained teams to set up and roll out these water
collection sites.
8.
Does Day Zero move?
Yes, Day Zero moves as it depends on the dam levels.
(Visit www.capetown.gov.za/dayzerodashboard)
The dam levels depend on water usage, evaporation, how much water the agricultural sector uses
and available water from the additional water supply projects.
Day Zero can be avoided. A number of Capetonians have done, and are doing, some amazing work
to save water. We now need all our residents to join in the savings drive and immediately bring their
daily use down to 50 litres per person.
Page 5 of 25The City is working tirelessly to do everything we can to avoid Day Zero. We are pursuing all
possibilities and have consulted experts in order to deliver on our plan to produce additional water
from multiple sources, between February 2018 and July 2019.
9.
Why was pressure reduction only started now and not earlier?
Pressure reduction has been ongoing for approximately 10 years. It was ramped up from March 2017
and throughout 2017. The City made decisions about the implementation of emergency measures
based on consumption patterns that remained above the target, as well as dam level changes.
Pressure reduction is a complex process. Unfortunately, it is not as straightforward as simply turning
off sections of the system, as this could lead to serious damage to the infrastructure.
10.
Will the City engage the private sector, NGOs, community structures, and any other
sector players for assistance?
The City has ongoing engagements with external stakeholders on how they can assist with managing
this drought and mitigating its effects.
The City cannot get Cape Town through the drought on its own. Constructive partnerships are vital.
All water users must support us and help to drive awareness to come up with solutions that will help
Cape Town through this unprecedented crisis.
Managing this disaster will require us as local government to coordinate with civil society at a level
that has never been seen before.
11.
Will there be further water restrictions?
Yes. We assess the situation constantly. Decisions might be communicated at short notice due to the
severity of the situation.
12.
Will new developments and other economic activity be limited if the situation becomes
worse?
We will take decisions that affect the City’s economy and jobs with the utmost care if the need arises.
We encourage the construction industry to save water and use treated effluent where possible that
the City has made available. All economic sectors must adhere to the water restrictions imposed by
the City and employ their own water storage and supply contingency measures where possible.
13.
What are businesses going to do that rely on water e.g. all the restaurants etc.? If they
are forced to close, the economic impact will be enormous.
Strategic commercial areas, high-density areas with significant risk of increased burden of disease,
such as informal settlements, and critical services, such as hospitals, old age homes, prisons,
hospitals, fire stations, police stations, clinics, children homes, where possible, will continue to receive
Page 6 of 25drinking water through normal channels. Significant monitoring and enforcement will be put in place to
ensure that water usage at these points is significantly reduced.
We are engaging with as many of these organisations as possible to work out what will be the best
way to meet their water needs in a Day Zero scenario. The crisis that we face requires a whole of
society approach. We will be discussing what strategies that organisations such as these will employ
to meet their water needs in the case of Day Zero – and how we can support the strategies in our
planning and implementation of the Water Disaster Plan.
14.
What steps is the City taking to go to businesses and inform/discuss with them how to
save water, and how to continue operating during Day Zero?
Business sector engagements have been taking place over the past few months and further
engagements are ongoing. The City is also sending out information directly to these stakeholders in
an effort to advise them of lowering consumption and preparing their operations if Day Zero is
reached.
15.
How long do you expect this level of water restrictions to be in place?
At least three to five months, depending on how the situation unfolds.
16.
I know that the focus is on Day Zero and avoiding it, but are we at a point where we are
considering winter and what that will bring?
Currently, the long-term prediction is not favourable for good rain during the start of winter, in fact it
indicates below normal rainfall. We are planning accordingly with further reduction, conservation
efforts and additional water projects.
17.
How will the City prevent people from selling water?
The sale of unmodified municipal water is unlawful in terms of our by-laws. It is, however, not
unlawful to sell ‘prepared water’ (i.e. water that has been modified with added flavours, bubbles, or
otherwise).
We can enforce our by-law, but the supply of bottled water is a supplier-consumer issue with which
we cannot interfere.
In general, (note this response does not apply to a particular company) it depends on the source of
the water. If water is being taken from the municipal supply it will constitute the resale of water which
is prohibited in terms of section 31 of the City of Cape Town’s Water By-law, 2010. They will then be
liable to a fine or imprisonment in terms of section 64 of the Water By-law, 2010.
If a company is abstracting water from an alternative source (other than from the municipal supply),
for example from boreholes or springs, then a formal application must be sent to the National
Department of Water and Sanitation. The latter is not within the City’s mandate to oversee.
Page 7 of 25Note, it is the responsibility of consumers to do their homework and to find out where the water comes
from (municipal supply or not) or whether approval has been granted by the National Government for
such use. Consumers must ensure that what they purchase is not unlawful. Demand proof of the
source of the water and whether it has been legitimately extracted.
Furthermore, the City can only guarantee that the water that we provide via the municipal supply is of
drinking-water quality. For all alternative sources of water, such as greywater or borehole water, or
water from springs and other sources, the City advises residents to only use it for flushing toilets.
Report all cases via 107 or 112 from a cell phone or 021 480 7700 or send a Whatsapp message to
063 407 3699 to report. Please note, always try to submit as much evidence as possible.
18.
What will happen to the sewer system if people can’t flush?
The City will provide residents with guidelines on managing sanitation within households to ensure
that impacts on the sewerage system are minimised. Additional actions will be taken by the City to
manage any sewerage build up and use alternative water to flush the system at strategic points.
Where residents have grey water, rain water and boreholes, this water should be prioritised for
flushing, to help keep the sewage system functioning.
Where non-drinking water is kept for flushing, this should not be stored for longer than three days.
Mark the containers clearly “FOR FLUSHING ONLY”. Alternative resources include:
 Borehole water
 Spring water
 From rivers/wetlands – best to use gloves when collecting non-drinking water and any household
disinfectant can be used. If in doubt contact your nearest Environmental Health Office.
 Use less toilet paper or single-ply toilet paper as this requires less water to flush
 Wet wipes and sanitary pads are not to be flushed down toilets as this causes blockages –wrap
and place in a dustbin.

19.
Don’t flush in a rush ‘if it’s yellow, let it mellow’.
Has consideration been given to the declaration of a state of emergency while the
collection points remain in operation?
Consideration has been given, but it is not a recommendation from the City at this stage.
20.
What will happen to other essential services if City officials are deployed at collection
sites?
This matter is still under discussion with the Disaster Coordinating Committee (DCC). Basic and
essential services, such as clinics, are to continue.
Page 8 of 2521.
Will residents be able to use seawater for some residential needs, such as flushing the
toilet? Is gathering seawater restricted?
In general, the City does not encourage the large-scale household-level flushing of toilets with
seawater. It could corrode parts of the reticulation infrastructure and our wastewater treatment
facilities are not designed to handle high salinity. As far as possible, residents are encouraged to use
appropriate greywater and alternative sources, such as from boreholes, to flush toilets.
As alternative resources could diminish due to usage limits, the City will flush the sewerage system at
appropriate points. This forms part of the comprehensive operational plan that the City is developing.
Highly experienced and qualified engineers are working hard at putting measures in place that will
ensure the system continues functioning as far as possible in the event of Day Zero occurring, to
safeguard both public health and the infrastructure.
We all have to reassess our relationship with water, and the City supports the move by residents to
explore more sustainable water-wise technologies such as composting/waterless toilets.
22.
What is the cost of this drought?
The City is continuously monitoring the impact of the drought on the City’s economy. All actions taken
terms of the Disaster Plan are based on minimising the economic impact of the drought on the City
and its residents. The cost to the economy is constantly weighed against the risk of water supply, with
the safety of residents being paramount.
23.
Those with boreholes and wellpoints – what are the dos and don’ts with that type of
water?
Please see link to Level 6 and Level 6B water restrictions. (Visit www.capetown.gov.za/thinkwater)
Firstly, the City does not regulate borehole usage. The custodian of water resources is the National
Department of Water and Sanitation. But the City has, in the implementation of previous water
restrictions, encouraged conservative usage of borehole water. We have recommended limited usage
in accordance with water restrictions for municipally-supplied drinking water.
Our Level 6b restrictions make further recommendations for the use of boreholes. It is not in the City’s
mandate to regulate the usage of groundwater sources, but we have tried as far as possible to drive
the message home that unlimited usage of boreholes is not sustainable.
The main consideration here is that private boreholes are not recharged. Private users do not replace
the underground water that is used. This is in contrast to the City’s aquifer programme, where aquifer
recharge will be a non-negotiable aspect of abstraction.
Our goal is not only to survive the drought and to thrive despite it, but to change our relationship with
water.
Page 9 of 25We advocate for the sustainable use of borehole water for indoor purposes but we do not support the
use of borehole water for outdoor purposes, such as gardening.
24.
During the Day Zero period, how will businesses be monitored in terms of their water
use?
As some key commercial areas will receive water via normal channels, businesses in these areas will
have their water use monitored via oversight of their accounts. We appeal in the most serious manner
that those with access to nodes that are still supplied, to not abuse this access and continue to treat
the existing water supply as severely scarce.
25.
Must I switch off my geyser as there will be no water in the pipes?
Residents are advised to switch off their geysers to avoid any damage that may be caused by water
suspension when the water comes back online again. Check your home insurance cover. The City is
not liable for any damages.
Switch off all plumbing that could result in leaks or water damage when the water comes back on.
Residents are advised to start adjusting their water stop-cocks now to reduce water usage, as
pressure reduction over the coming months before Day Zero could cause temporary interruption of
supply. If the water flow is reduced, any damage will be minimised once the water comes back on.
26.
Will it be business as usual (work and school etc.) should Day Zero happen?
It will largely be left up to relevant role players in these sectors to determine suitable contingency
plans and concessions for employees and students.
In terms of educational facilities, this would be for schools, governing bodies and the relevant
government departments to collectively decide on.
Residents should be aware that the Day Zero phase is an extreme disaster scenario, and significant
disruption of daily life is to be expected.
Page 10 of 2527.
Why has the City not (substantially) reduced pressure on water? Would this result in
some areas being cut off? But then can't special provisions be made for these areas in
the meanwhile?
The City has in fact been substantially reducing water pressure since March 2017. Our engineers
have been reducing water pressure in the bulk pipes at our reservoirs as well as in the reticulation
network that feeds our households. Much of this work has been an engineering-first.
Water flows to a property because of the action of water pressure. For the water to reach different
areas, pressure must be managed. This is done by controlling the flow of water to every area in the
city. Some areas in the city are located at lower points, while others are located higher up. Water, like
everything else, is bound by the laws of gravity. So, it will either flow downwards or it will remain at the
same level. If we want it to get to higher-lying areas, or properties located on high ground or into tall
buildings, we need to use valves and pumps to get it to those areas.
To get through this drought, there are water restrictions and water usage limits in place. We then
provide the allowable water to an area. If everyone stays within their daily usage limit, households
should not be affected by rationing. But if people in a lower-lying area do not stick to this allocation,
people in higher-lying areas are affected. Even with reduced pressure, lower-lying areas will have
water as it flows easier because of gravity. But, if the flow is reduced, the water does not have
sufficient pressure to flow to higher-lying areas or buildings.
That is why tall buildings and higher-lying areas will often be affected by pressure management.
Some areas will not have water.
The City’s water reticulation network provides water at pressures between 2.4 and 9 bar.
Operational staff have lowered the pressures across the City but the intention is to keep the system
pressurised (keep water flowing). This is because a lot of damage could be done if we switch off this
pressure system entirely.
High-rise buildings and dwellings located 10 m or higher than road level will be impacted indefinitely
but theoretically everyone living at ground level should have water supply at their metered connection.
However, when many users draw water at once, a peak in the demand is created. This happens
when, for example, people tend to do laundry in the morning or shower at more or less the same time
during the day. This peak (typically between 05:00 and 09:00 and between 17:00 and 21:00) will draw
down the system creating a temporary outage. In this case the system should recover once the
demand decreases, i.e. after the washing is on the line. Residents on higher-lying areas within
pressure zones are vulnerable and their water supply is dependent on their lower-lying neighbours.
Page 11 of 25From our reservoirs, we have allocated the precise amount of water that could be required for
essential usage while protecting the resources that we have left. Nothing more is given than what is
required. It is therefore up to all of us to ensure that we stick to our daily limits. When pressure
management is introduced, it remains active in an area all the time. No outages are planned as they
are solely dependent on the behaviour of users. Because we cannot physically control the behaviour
of users, we cannot guess how long it will take for an area to get its water usage down to what is
required.
Further advanced pressure management is being rolled out, with some areas at 0,5 bars and lower.
But, adjustments may be made on an hourly basis if required.
That is why the City has been advising since March to keep some water for non-essential use but not
to store excessive municipal water.
Bringing down the demand through pressure management and communication to promote water
reduction among our users has been a vital intervention in helping to buy us time and to stretch our
water supplies further.
28.
Are plans being made to collect the excess plastic that will result from the huge
increase in bottled water sales?
The City’s drop-off facilities will be key. We have diverted more than 50% of our waste from landfills
already, and we expect this practice to continue.
29.
The city claims about 60% of people aren't saving water. How does it calculate this?
And what steps are being taken to stop people using excessive water?
This is based on the billing information of account holders. It looks at what should be paid if one is
within the limits, and then identifies the account holders who are over that and who have not applied
for quota increases.
Daily enforcement operations are ongoing, public awareness campaigns carry on and the installation
of water management devices for high water users at their cost (currently, more than 2 000 per week
are being fitted and we aim to increase this to more than 3 500 per week).
The pending implementation of new water and sanitation tariffs will also aim to change behaviour.
High tariffs for the highest users will assist to drive down consumption.
Page 12 of 2530.
How advanced are plans to use large scale desalination? How much water will
desalination eventually bring online, and by when? Will these desalination plants be
powered with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind?
Our modular reverse osmosis desalination plants are designed to have the smallest ecological
footprint possible. An inter-governmental environmental monitoring team is also in place to monitor all
projects.
The V&A desalination plant (two million litres per day) is planned to start producing water by
March/April 2018. We are still on track for this.
The Strandfontein plant (seven million litres per day) is due to start producing water from March 2018.
The Monwabisi plant (seven million litres per day) has been delayed to facilitate further community
engagement in the area. The plant was due to start producing water by February, but four weeks of
construction time has been lost to date. With the support of the community, the City is all hands on
deck to get this project going again and to make up for delays.
Any desalination plant contracts awarded to contractors as part of the City’s Emergency Water
Augmentation Scheme will be required to deliver water that must meet South African National
Standards (SANS 241:2015) requirements. These are the standards set nationally for drinking water
quality. The City has a proud record of always meeting these standards. The desalination plants will
have online monitoring equipment installed to check the efficacy of the desalination process and
adherence to the SANS standard.
After advice from the World Bank, the City shifted focus from desalination to optimising the use of
aquifers in the short term, as this is more cost effective and quicker to implement than temporary
desalination plants.
The Cape Flats aquifer will deliver 80 million litres per day, the Table Mountain Group aquifer will
deliver 40 million litres per day, and the Atlantis aquifer will deliver 30 million litres per day over
2017/18 and 2019/20.
The groundwater abstraction projects form part of the City’s programme to supply additional water
from desalination, water recycling and groundwater abstraction.
Abstracting groundwater in bigger volumes means that the City can deliver more water at a lower cost
to benefit all residents of Cape Town.
Page 13 of 25Water Collection Points
31.
Where can we find information about the collection sites?
A map of the collection points along with necessary information will be publicised over the coming
weeks and placed on the City’s website. Signage will be placed in each community indicating where
the nearest water collection point is situated. All essential information on the Water Collection Sites
will be placed on the City’s website and communicated via multiple communication channels –
including electronic communication channels such as SMS, email and social media and physical
communications in the form of posters, signage and pamphlets.
We have not finalised each and every detail yet.
If we want this Disaster Plan to be adopted with as little risk and inconvenience as possible, we need
to look to the local context of each water distribution point. We need to anticipate what strategies
households and businesses will employ to meet their water needs in the case of Day Zero – and how
we can support these strategies instead of frustrating them.
We need to design and manage these collection points in a way that makes sense. It is essential that
our approach is flexible enough to maximise efficiency as far as possible. There are some operational
details of the water collection points that will undergo continuous refinement right up until Day Zero.
We need to design and manage these collection points in a way that makes sense – to maximise
efficiency.
In order to do this the Disaster Risk Management Team is labouring over questions such as:
 What range and size of containers will people choose to use?
 How will they carry these containers to and from the standpipe?
 What time of day will they come to the Collection Point?
 What transport will they opt to use to and from the Collection Point?
 How will families and neighbours organise themselves to collect water in a way that makes
sense?

Who within the household or business will be designated to collect water and for how many
people will they collect?
For the next two months we will be trouble-shooting each Water Collection Point so that if Day Zero
arrives, people are able to collect water as quickly and safely as possible.
The one thing that is certain is that even if these water collection points run as smoothly as possible,
the act of collecting water will be a massive inconvenience for Capetonians. If we don’t want to queue,
we will all need to save water now.
Page 14 of 2532.
What will a water collection site look like?
The collection points will comprise pedestrian and drive-through options. Each point will have a Venue
Operations Centre where Disaster Risk Management staff will coordinate with Law Enforcement, City
officials and volunteers to manage the collection of water at these sites. There will also be a medical
point at each site.
The following is an example:
33.
What will the operating hours of these collection sites be?
The operating hours will be tailored to what makes sense in terms of the times of day that are most
convenient for persons to collect water and also taking into account minimising queue lengths. The
operating hours will be adjusted and extended according to need.
Residents will be asked to avoid peak times, if possible, to minimise queue lengths.
34.
How many water outlets will be available at these points?
Each Water Collection Point will have more than 50 taps. Where space permits, some Water
Collection Points will be geared primarily for vehicles in order to allow for drive-through water
collection.
Page 15 of 25The City has technical specifications, which include the number of standpipes and water flow rate.
These factors will determine the number of people that we can serve per site. At the moment 149 of
the 200 sites have been confirmed and we will be erecting signage at these points within the coming
weeks so that persons in these communities are aware of where their collection point will be situated.
These collection points will contain sections for pedestrian and vehicular collections in order to
maximise efficiency as much as possible.
35.
Will residents have to pay for this water?
No payment will be required at the collection points. There will still be a tariff levied as part of the rates
bill for the sustaining of the water reticulation system and treatment of the water.
36.
How much water per person will be available?
Each person is allowed 25 litres of water per day for personal use. However, any one person will be
permitted to collect up to 100 litres per collection.
It is anticipated that some people will collect 100 litres to use for themselves over four days. Others
will be collecting the daily water allocation for other members of their family or community.
37.
Are you going to have enough time to set up all the required operations?
Yes. It will take approximately six weeks to set up.
38.
From where will the water supply to the collection points come? And how long is it set
to last?
Water collection points will be activated when dams reach 13,5%. Most taps will be shut off in phases
so that the last available water in our dams can be preserved for basic use until we receive rainfall,
and until additional water from aquifers, desalination and recycling schemes can be brought online.
The water at the collection points will be fed through sections of the existing reticulation system that
have been isolated to keep running.
39.
What happens when this water runs out?
With the drastic reduction in consumption that will be seen once taps are turned off and collection
points are activated, the last reserves are expected to stretch far enough to see us through to the
rainy season. Additional water from new resources will help to extend water resources but for the
immediate future, only to a small extent.
40.
What level of regulation will be in place at the Water Collection Sites?
The City will take reasonable measures to ensure that water rationing happens fairly and
appropriately.
Page 16 of 25In order to keep the Water Distribution Sites operating as efficiently as possible, only light regulation
will be put in place to monitor how much water each person is collecting. The onus is on our water
users to act responsibly, honestly, fairly and conscientiously during this crisis.
No one will be turned away from the Water Collection Point. All persons living in Cape Town will be
entitled to collecting water at these points. Being in possession of a South African ID or water account
bill will not be a pre-requisite for people to collect their daily allocation of water.
41.
Will people be permitted to collect water for others?
The City will take reasonable measures to ensure that water rationing happens fairly and
appropriately. Households and individuals will adapt to this crisis differently and the City is aware of
the need for flexibility at sites.
It is important that persons are permitted to collect water for others as not all members of society will
be able to collect water for themselves, for example young children, the elderly and disabled.
Also, allowing persons to collect water for others will reduce the number of persons queuing at the
Water Collection Sites on any given day.
In terms of preventing abuse, we will all need to work together to ensure efficient functioning of the
sites and fair access to water for all residents.
42.
How will water collection be monitored?
We can assure residents that there will be an official presence at collection points to prevent abuse of
the system and to limit undue inconvenience.
The rules around collection sites will be finalised once we have more detailed information on factors
such as:
 How many people each site will provide water to
 How quickly and efficiently this water can be distributed
 What level of oversight we can provide
 Any system we put in place will to a certain degree have to rely on residents to act in a
conscientious and conservative manner when collecting water for it to work as efficiently as
possible.
43.
What control measures will be in place to prevent someone from going from one point
to another to collect more than their allocation?
The City will institute appropriate measures to ensure that daily supply limits are not abused,
however, the practical design of the sites and the water collection system will limit the possibilities for
Page 17 of 25abuse. The City does not expect significant and wide scale abuse to occur due to the practical
challenge of collecting and transporting large amounts of water.
We will all need to work together to ensure efficient functioning of the sites and fair access to water for
all residents.
44.
Will the City supply residents with containers?
Unfortunately, it is not feasible for the City to provide residents with containers.
The City will conduct a wide-scale call to action for the donation of containers for those who cannot
afford to purchase a suitable container for the collection of water. These donated containers will be
available at the sites to respond to need.
45.

What kind of containers are recommended?
A dedicated container is needed for the collection of drinking water – clearly labelled ‘drinking
water’.
 If possible, use hard plastic, durable containers that can be sealed.
 This container should not have been used previously for the storage of harmful substances such
as cleaning detergents, pesticides, etc.
46.
How should we store water?
 Store the water in a cool, dry place.
 Make sure that the containers are closed and sealed during storage. Boil the water before use
when in doubt.
 The container must have a top that can be tightly closed.
 Containers must be made of durable, unbreakable material (i.e. not glass).
 Do not use containers which have previously been used to store chemical or toxic substances.
47.
How will the City ensure sanitation at the collection sites?
Chemical toilets will be available at each site.
48.
How will the City ensure water quality at the collection sites?
Water that is fed to the sites will have undergone normal treatment and quality control processes,
overseen by the City’s department of Scientific Services. Should there be any drop in quality this will
Page 18 of 25be picked up very quickly and the appropriate interventions taken immediately. In addition to this level
of surety, we will make water testing kits available on-site and test the water daily.
49.
What assistance will be provided to vulnerable people to assist them to collect water
from these sites, particularly the elderly and people with disabilities?
We are aware that special provisions need to be made to ensure all people are able to access water,
particularly those who are physically unable to collect it from a Water Collection Point.
We are engaging with national government, provincial government, businesses, communities and
NGOs to support us to care for our most vulnerable residents, such as the elderly and those with
disabilities, during this time.
Mass information sessions are being set up with Neighbourhood Watch Groups, NGOs, religious
organisations and community groups to brief them on the Critical Water Shortages Disaster Plan and
the role they will need to play in ensuring that all persons are able to access their 25 litres of water per
day.
Ensuring that the persons described above are able to access water during this time will require a
massive coordination effort from government and civil society. As part of the information sessions, we
will be asking partners to gather information on extremely vulnerable persons in the areas where they
operate.
There will be a wide-scale call to action for these organisations to volunteer to collect water for
vulnerable persons.
Subcouncils and Ward Committees will be driving the identification of vulnerable persons in their
areas and aligning these with local Civil Society Organisations who can assist them during this time of
crisis.
50.
What about people who don’t have transport to get to water collection sites? Will free
transport be provided?
Able-bodied residents will need to find their own way of getting to and from the collection points.
Public transport will be available as usual. Other distribution mechanisms are being investigated. We
are selecting sites to try and provide reasonable access to as many residents as possible and are
talking to civil society about ways to assist vulnerable people.
51.
How many personnel will be working at the water collection sites?
The number of personnel working at a site will depend on the layout, security risk assessment and
population throughput. A high-risk water collection site’s environment set-up would require
approximately 90 people on site to provide all services.
Page 19 of 2552.
How much time in total (including queuing) do you expect people to require on
average?
Exact times cannot be determined at this stage. The City will make every effort to ensure operations
are optimised to keep queuing time to a minimum. However, residents should not underestimate the
severity of the situation and should prepare to wait in queues to collect water, especially during peak
times.
53.
Will the water collection points be able to manage inclement weather?
Yes, where possible shading will be provided to protect those queuing from the sun. However,
residents are advised to prepare as they normally would for inclement weather.
54.
What security will be provided at Water Collection Sites?
The deployment of security policing role players will depend on the categorising of the Points of
Distribution in terms of High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk. The services included in the
deployment will be SAPS, Metro police, traffic and law enforcement.
SAPS and SANDF have confirmed that they will assist the City with the securing of these Water
Collection Points.
The deployment will include inner perimeter security, as well as the outer perimeter security. We will
have static deployment and rotational vehicle patrols.
55.
Apart from security at water collection points, have we given serious enough
consideration to the situation in gang-ravaged areas and how that might affect
people’s ability to access Water Collection Points?
An extensive integrated security plan has been developed to address the situation in gang-ravaged
areas, this includes deployment from SAPS, Metro Police, Law Enforcement, Neighbourhood Watch
groups and Community Police Forums. Taking into account security concerns, Provincial Joints and
National Joints structures have been established to provide for National Departmental assistance,
which includes the SANDF.

56.
Has the city put in place a public health program to address potential health problems,
e.g. water borne diseases such as cholera?
The City is part of an established outbreak response team together with Provincial Government.
All notifiable cases of disease are investigated thoroughly to determine the source and to ensure that
appropriate containment measures are enacted, where necessary.
Health officers are actively monitoring the incidence of cases during the diarrhoea season to pick up
trends in order to ensure rapid responses to disease outbreaks
Healthcare facilities ensure that individuals who are sick and dehydrated (especially children) receive
priority treatment to prevent disease progression.
57.
Will the national and provincial Government play a role to assist the City should there
be a water-related disease outbreak?
Critical services (for example hospitals) will continue to receive drinking water through normal
channels. We will implement significant monitoring and enforcement measures to ensure that water
usage at these points is significantly reduced. Any water-borne disease outbreak will be jointly
managed by the City, Provincial and National health departments.
58.
What measures have the City put in place to combat likely disease outbreaks?
Preventative measures:
 Increased health and hygiene programmes
 City clinics have regular health talks about the prevention of water- and food-borne diseases and
diarrhoea danger signs

Posters at Water Collection Sites
People should not stop their normal precautionary health measures during this crisis.

The public is encouraged to continue with their routine visitations to health clinics and ensure all
immunisations of all family members are up to date.
 The City will continue to promote childhood vaccinations at all its healthcare facilities.
 When persons display symptoms of dehydration they should drink a sugar/salt solution (Half a
teaspoon of salt, eight teaspoons of sugar in one litre of water) and if the symptoms persist then
proceed to the nearest clinic for treatment.
59.
Will the City provide information of the need to keep hands clean above all else during
the Day Zero period and discouraging handshaking?
Yes, the City will provide sanitary guidelines.

60.
What can we do to contain disease outbreaks?
The City is part of an established outbreak response team together with Provincial Government.
All notifiable cases of disease are investigated thoroughly to determine the source and appropriate
containment measures are enacted, where necessary.
Health officers are actively interrogating any information during the diarrhoea season to pick up trends
in order to ensure rapid responses to disease outbreaks.
Healthcare facilities ensure that individuals who are sick and dehydrated (especially children) are fast-
tracked to prevent disease progression.
61.
Is the City stockpiling antibiotics?
The City’s clinics will be capacitated to see to those in need.
62.
What health risks will become more prevalent during Day Zero?
Water-borne diseases will likely become more prevalent, linked to the improper storage of water
where contaminated containers are used. These include: Diarrhoea, Hepatitis A, and Typhoid Fever.
Handwashing and washing of fruit and vegetables is imperative
Food-borne diseases will likely become more prevalent, due to cross contamination and insufficient
sanitisation of foods and food preparation surfaces.
The five key food safety tips are:
Page 22 of 25 Wash your hands with your allocated water
 Separate raw and cooked food
 Cook food thoroughly
 Keep food at safe temperatures
 Use clean water and fresh food

Where will the water come from to fight big vegetation fires, which are characteristic of
this time of year?
The current water crisis necessitated the Fire and Rescue Service to rethink the current strategy
around how we will manage fires over this period.
The Fire and Rescue Service also has five Compressed Air Foam System (CAFS) vehicles that use a
foam/water concentrate mix. These vehicles are being dispatched first where possible to contain fires
and limit the use of potable water. We are looking to retrofit some of our other vehicles to perform in a
similar manner in the months ahead, although this is budget dependent.
Treated effluent is also being used to an extent where possible.
For vegetation fires, the helicopters contracted for the summer season will use seawater to fight
flames in areas that are inaccessible to firefighters. On the ground, greater emphasis will be placed
on perimeter firefighting and monitoring. Fire and Rescue Services will always consider life and
property as a first priority, and should drinking water have to be used in these instances, we will do so
to save same. In addition, the Fire and Rescue Service is ramping up its education and awareness
campaigns around fire safety in the home, but also in public and the maintenance of fire breaks.
The summer season, coupled with the water shortage, requires that the public seriously consider their
actions around the use of fire during this period. They are requested to be cautious and vigilant, and
to report fires as soon as they are witnessed in order that the emergency fire-fighting services can
reach them as quickly as possible. The public are also assured that the Fire and Rescue Service will
do all in their power to combat fires if and when they occur, using the most convenient alternate water
sources available.
64.
How will fires in buildings and businesses be handled?
The City advises all businesses and facility managers in the public and private sector to get up to
speed about how to treat fires during a period of extreme drought especially when water pressure
may also be lowered dramatically in an effort to suppress demand.
According to building regulations sprinkler systems need to be installed however, during the disaster
phase no water will feed into a fire sprinkler system. Businesses must please check their insurance.
Tips:
 Ensure that water pressure remains adequate for your needs.
 Ensure all fire hydrants are in working condition and serviced and acquire more if required.
Page 24 of 25
Ensure that all staff and occupants know the emergency processes that are related to a fire i.e.
conduct regular fire drills.

Speak to your insurer to ensure that you are aware of all requirements and consequences of
pressure management/flooding and fires.

65.
Conduct ongoing staff and occupant awareness initiatives.
What will happen if there are fires in informal settlements?
The City aims to ensure that water supply and pressure remains as adequate as possible in informal
settlements. Informal settlements which are responsible for approximately 4% of our water usage are
also at a high risk of fire-, floods and disease due to the informal nature of these settlements and the
high densities.
